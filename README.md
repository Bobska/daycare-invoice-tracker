## Testing

To test the application:

1. **Admin Interface**: Visit `/admin/` and log in with superuser credentials
2. **User Registration**: Create a new user account
3. **Dashboard**: View the main dashboard with statistics
4. **Navigation**: Test all navigation links
5. **Models**: Create test data through admin to see dashboard populate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure virtual environment is activated
- **Database errors**: Run `python manage.py migrate`
- **Static files not loading**: Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
- **Permission errors**: Check file permissions in media directory

### Development Server:
```bash
# Check for issues
python manage.py check

# Run tests (when implemented)
python manage.py test

# Shell access for debugging
python manage.py shell
```
